1. Experimenting with Shared Memory Between Two Separate Processes: 'Producer' and 'Consumer'

	- First, compile and run the producer.c program.
	- Next, compile and run the consumer.c program.
	- Refer to the header comments in both producer.c and consumer.c for detailed information about the implementation.



2. Experimenting with Shared Memory Between a 'Parent' and Its 'Child' Process

	- Compile and execute the Shm.c program.
	- Check the header comments in Shm.c for more details about how shared memory is used in this example.
